## Movie-Management-System
- This management system will provide movie details about any movie that the user wants to know about. These details include Cast details, Director, Producer details, Genre of the movie, etc. 
- Our database system will allow the user to filter the movies based on the filter criteria provided in our system like genre, rating, casts, etc. It also allows the user to check if the movie is available in any nearby theaters based on the userâ€™s zip code. If the movie is not currently available in any theaters, we will provide the details of the streaming platform where the movie is currently being streamed.
- More details about the project and the system is included in the pdf file under documents folder.
- The application is built using streamlit and postgreSQL
